		<h1>Project Analysis | Get Gaming Orlando</h1>
		<h2>Site Intent</h2>
		<p>The intent of the Get Gaming Orlando redesign to to make the website look more professional, fix any errors, increase traffic, and improve customer satisfaction.</p>
		<p>The redesign process will start with the content; figure out what needs to stay and what could/should be removed. Next, I will focus on the layout of the site. By making the layout easier to navigate as well as look out, will help increase the User Usability. And then finally I will fix the site's aesthics by making it more cleaner as well as making it look more professional looking.</h2>
