		<h1>Project Analysis | Get Gaming Orlando</h1>
		<h2>Site Intent</h2>
		<p>The intent of the Get Gaming Orlando redesign to to make the website look more professional, fix errors on the site, improve traffic, and improve customer satisfaction.</p>
		<p>The redesign will start with stripping out any unnessecary content. Then fix any errors that the site currently has such as the navigation disappearing when on the servicerea.html and any validation errors that occured. Then I will improve the site's aesthics by making it more user-friendly as well as professional looking. I will also add content to help improve the site's usability such as a form field to make it easier for a user to get in contact and add a mobile version for user's on the go.</p>
